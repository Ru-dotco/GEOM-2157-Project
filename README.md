# GEOM-2157-Project
This PyQGIS script provides a customised calculation of environmental factors used to analyse site suitability for landfills. The script combines a calculation of slope, drainage density and a weighted sum of these criteria to produce proposed sites suitable for new landfills. 
The coordinate reference system for the files is GDA94/MGA zone 54 and EPSG: 28354. A PyQGIS plugin, derived from the course materials, is included to reproject additional files the user adds to the analysis.
